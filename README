Octave Multi-Channel Signal Processing

These are the tools i wrote while working on my PhD thesis. Trying to keep
everything in one easy to configure framework resulted in this little
collection.

There is a lot of room for improvements, lot of unused or commented code and
even possibly wrong calculations.

Feel free to improve, find bugs, add features add test cases and of course use
these tools.

The best starting points are the defaults.m file which contains all keys and
their standard values. Also look at the much too few test cases in tests/ and
the script using this framework in scripts/.

At the moment everything should work in Octave and Matlab, but because of not
having access to Matlab in the future this can not be guarantied anymore.
